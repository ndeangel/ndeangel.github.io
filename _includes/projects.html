    <h3> POLAR </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">POLAR was a compact Compton polarimeter located on the Tiangong-2 Chinese space lab dedicated to the measurement of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission polarization. It took scientific data for about 6 months starting September 2016 and detected 55 GRBs as well as several pulsars and solar flares. Joint polarization and spectral analysis lead to the conclusion that most of the detected GRBs were consistent with unpolarized or lowly polarized sources, excluding synchrotron emission models with ordered magnetic fields. Time resolved analysis showed a hint for a time evolving polarization angle within a GRB single pulse, washing out the polarization fraction on time integrated studies.</p>

    <h3> POLAR-2 </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">POLAR-2 is large scale gamma-ray polarimeter based on the legacy of the POLAR experiment. It is currently being developped for a targeted launch early 2025 to the China Space Station (CSS) for a nominal operation time of 2 years. With a 4 times bigger instrument than its predecessor, and technological upgrades improving the effective area a low energies, POLAR-2 aims to provide high quality joint polarization-spectral measurements of about 50 GRBs every year. The higher statistics will allow detailed time and energy dependant polarization analyses of these GRBs' prompt emission.</p>

    <h3> eXTP </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP) is a science mission designed to study the state of matter under extreme conditions of density, gravity and magnetism. Primary goals are the determination of the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear density, the measurement of QED effects in highly magnetized star, and the study of accretion in the strong-field regime of gravity. Primary targets include isolated and binary neutron stars, strong magnetic field systems like magnetars, and stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.</p>

    <h3> SMILE </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">SMILE (Student Moon Initiative for Lunar Exploration) is an international graduate-student-led space mission with a team of mostly doctoral students. The goal of our mission is to land a small (CubeSat-sized) spacecraft that conducts meaningful science on the surface of the moon by 2024. The objective of the primary payloads is to perform in-situ measurements of the radiation environment on the lunar surface and to characterize the behavior of radiation resistant biological organisms for future manned lunar exploration.</p>

    <h3> CTA </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy at very-high energies. With more than 100 telescopes located in the northern and southern hemispheres, CTA will be the worldâ€™s largest and most sensitive high-energy gamma-ray observatory.</p>
